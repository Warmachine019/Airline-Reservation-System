3. Create a folder in xmapp > htdocs called "airline_reservation"
4. Paste "index.php" in the "airline_reservation" folder you just created
5. Go back to the xmapp folder and run "xmapp-control.exe"
6. Start the "MySQL" and "Apache" modules by clicking "Start" under "Actions"
7. Open "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" in your browser.
8. Create a new database called "airline_reservation".
9. Create a new table in the database using SQL by pasting "SQL_Query.txt".
10. Finally, use this link to make everything work together "http://localhost/airline_reservation/index.php"
